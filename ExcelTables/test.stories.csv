653434f203759a7afa4d23af,65340caa03759a7afa4d2313,Health Vs Wealth,"<p>Hi! This is my first blog. I would like to share my opinions about the debatable topic of “Health vs Wealth.”</p><p>Health is the biggest wealth for a human being. &nbsp;One can’t survive without good health. &nbsp; Health is something that we can’t buy with money. &nbsp;Without proper health, life can’t be enjoyed to the fullest. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i>&nbsp;So what truly makes us rich?</i> &nbsp;<strong>MONEY</strong> &nbsp;or &nbsp;<strong>HEALTH</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;<i>Can we feel complete and happy without good health?&nbsp;</i></li></ul><p><i><strong>Health</strong></i>:- Imagine a person having a lot of wealth but with a health complication which is not treatable… &nbsp;Can Ambani eat more than a box full of sweets or dish full of biryani? &nbsp;How much ever we earn, we are restricted to our capacity which is of a human being. &nbsp;An empty pocket maybe manageable but a tense mind is harmful.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Wealth</strong></i>:-Prevention is better than cure! &nbsp;Money can provide better medical resources and care. &nbsp; To a certain extent money can safeguard health. &nbsp;In a journey to earn more and more for our needs and wants we forget the main purpose. &nbsp;Money then brings stress, restlessness, and ultimately leads to bad health. &nbsp;The main purpose of needs and wants we aspire to buy using money is to ensure good life which points to our good health.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Simple ways to ensure healthy life</strong></i>:-</p><ol><li>In the morning , do at least half an hour of physical and mental exercise of any type.&nbsp;</li><li>Limit the amount of intake of highly processed or toxic foods. &nbsp;</li><li>Increase water consumption. &nbsp;</li><li>Avoid soda drinks or drinks with artificial sugar content and decrease the amount of consuming red meat(e.g. lamb etc.), eat fish and vegetables.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Avoid dairy products and alcohol as well.&nbsp;</li><li>Don’t eat fried foods or fast foods daily in excess quantity.&nbsp;</li><li>Spend some alone time and think positively about your future and present life.</li><li>This brings positive vibes that boost up your positive energy.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Health is the most important wealth. &nbsp;Once lost, money is earnable but health isn’t! Prevention is better than cure, so we shouldn’t be carless towards the main aspect of our lives racing behind wealth. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Make healthy lifestyle a priority&nbsp;</strong></p>",image_2023-10-21T20-30-42.593Zhw.png,1,6534371103759a7afa4d2434,653ad708d29771de1f0447c4,2,6534375403759a7afa4d2448,653ad979d29771de1f0447e3,,2,2023-10-21T20:30:42.603Z,2023-10-26T21:26:17.906Z,health-vs-wealth,8
6534d86a923cc5781d97b6fd,6534371103759a7afa4d2434,The Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney - Review,"<p><i><strong>I give this a big 5/5</strong></i></p><p>The Diary of a Wimpy Kid books are all about a kid called Greg who fills in his <i>journal </i>(not a diary!!) of all the misadventures in his life.</p><p>Everything Greg seems to do has hilarious consequences and his family are very funny. In this book it is summer vacation and even though it is nice and hot Greg insists on staying inside hooked up to his video games with the blinds drawn. His mother is tired of Greg being lazy and decides that this summer should be fun and packed with family activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This book was very good. My favorite character has to be Greg as he can be horrible but the audience always roots for him anyway! I really like the part when Greg's mum is forgotten by the whole family at a petrol station in the middle of nowhere - it is hilarious.</p><p>I recommend this book to readers around 10-13 who enjoy reading as it is quite easy to read, but it has some challenging words as well.</p><p>I give this a big 5/5 because I enjoyed reading it so much.</p>",image_2023-10-22T08-08-09.996Zdiaryof.png,0,65340caa03759a7afa4d2313,653ad708d29771de1f0447c4,2,6534dd28825dc9686ba059ab,65382bd6164f5562f68cfaef,653ad9acd29771de1f044801,3,2023-10-22T08:08:10.034Z,2023-10-26T21:27:09.215Z,the-diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-by-jeff-kinney-review,5
653ad855d29771de1f0447cb,653ad708d29771de1f0447c4,Conventional and Non-conventional Sources of Energy,"<p><strong>The two major sources of energy is classified as:</strong></p><ul><li>Conventional Sources</li><li>Non-Conventional Sources</li></ul><h2><strong>Conventional Sources of Energy</strong></h2><p>Conventional Sources of Energy are also known as non renewable sources of energy and are available in limited quantity apart from hydro-electric power. Further, it is classified under commercial and non-commercial energy.</p><h3><strong>Commercial Energy Sources</strong></h3><p>Coal, electricity and petroleum are known as commercial energy since the consumer needs to pay its price to buy them.</p><h4><strong>Coal</strong></h4><p>Coal is the most important source of energy. There are more than 148790 coal deposits in India, and between 2005-2006, the annual production went up to 343 million tons. India is the fourth-largest coal-producing country, and the deposits are primarily found in Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bengal.</p><h4><strong>Oil and Natural Gas</strong></h4><p>Oil is considered liquid gold and one of the crucial energy sources in India and the world. Oil is primarily used in planes, automobiles, trains and ships. The total oil production in India was 0.3 million tons in 1950-51, which increased up to 32.4 million tons in 2000-01. It is mainly found in Assam, Gujarat and Mumbai.</p><h4><strong>Electricity</strong></h4><p>Electricity is a common form of energy used for domestic and commercial purposes, and it is mainly utilized in electrical appliances like fridges, T.V, washing machines and air conditioning.</p><p>The major sources of power generation are:</p><ul><li>Nuclear Power</li><li>Thermal Power</li><li>Hydro-electric power</li></ul><p><strong>Thermal Power-</strong>Thermal power is generated at various power stations utilizing oil and coal. It is a vital source of electric current, and its share in the nation’s total capacity in 2004-05 was 70 percent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hydroelectric Power-</strong>Hydroelectric power is produced by constructing dams above flowing rivers like Damodar Valley Project and Bhakra Nangal Project. The installed capacity of hydroelectric power was 587.4 mW in 1950-51 and went up to 19600 mW in 2004-05.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nuclear Power-</strong>The fuel used in nuclear power plants is Uranium, which costs less than coal. Nuclear power plants can be found in Kaiga (Karnataka), Kota (Rajasthan), Naroura (UP) and Kalapakam(Chennai).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Non-commercial Energy Sources</strong></h3><p>Generally, the freely available energy sources are considered non-commercial energy sources. Examples of non-commercial energy sources include straw, dried dung, firewood.</p><h2><strong>Non-Conventional Sources of Energy</strong></h2><p>Non-conventional sources are also known as renewable sources of energy. Examples of non-conventional sources of energy include solar energy, bioenergy, tidal energy and wind energy.</p><h3><strong>Solar Energy</strong></h3><p>Solar Energy is produced by sunlight. The photovoltaic cells are exposed to sunlight based on the form of electricity that needs to be produced. The energy is utilized for cooking and distillation of water.</p><h3><strong>Wind Energy</strong></h3><p>Wind energy is generated by harnessing the power of wind and mostly used in operating water pumps for irrigation purposes. India stands as the second-largest country in the generation of wind power.</p><h3><strong>Tidal Energy</strong></h3><p>Tidal energy is generated by exploiting the tidal waves of the sea. This source is yet to be tapped due to the lack of cost-effective technology.</p>",image_2023-10-26T21-21-25.708ZConventional-and-Non-conventional-Sources-of-Energy.png,2,6534d9c5923cc5781d97b751,,1,653ad9eed29771de1f04481e,,,1,2023-10-26T21:21:25.718Z,2023-10-26T21:28:15.232Z,conventional-and-non-conventional-sources-of-energy,2
653adc70d29771de1f04482a,6534d9c5923cc5781d97b751,Solar System,"<p>The Solar System is made up of the Sun and all of the smaller objects that move around it. Apart from the Sun, the largest members of the Solar System are the eight major planets. Nearest the Sun are four fairly small, rocky planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.</p><p>Beyond Mars is the asteroid belt – a region populated by millions of rocky objects. These are left-overs from the formation of the planets, 4.5 billion years ago.</p><p>On the far side of the asteroid belt are the four gas giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. These planets are much bigger than Earth, but very lightweight for their size. They are mostly made of hydrogen and helium.</p><p>Until recently, the furthest known planet was an icy world called Pluto. However, Pluto is dwarfed by Earth’s Moon and many astronomers think it is too small to be called a true planet.</p><p>An object named Eris, which is at least as big as Pluto, was discovered very far from the Sun in 2005. More than 1,000 icy worlds such as Eris have been discovered beyond Pluto in recent years. These are called Kuiper Belt Objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided that Pluto and Eris must be classed as “dwarf planets”.</p><p>Even further out are the comets of the Oort Cloud. These are so far away that they are invisible in even the largest telescopes. Every so often one of these comets is disturbed and heads towards the Sun. It then becomes visible in the night sky.</p>",image_2023-10-26T21-38-56.052Zsolarsystem.jpg,1,65340caa03759a7afa4d2313,,1,653adf1bd29771de1f044844,,,1,2023-10-26T21:38:56.058Z,2023-10-26T21:50:19.429Z,solar-system,2
