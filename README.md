**BRRRGRRR**-
This user interface is meant to serve as an online website that sells burgers. It suggests users to not only customize their burgers by adding or removing ingredients but also create their own burger from the ingredients in stock. The "Brrrgrrr" Frontend Project is designed to revolutionize the online food ordering experience by giving users unprecedented control over their burger selections. It leverages modern web development techniques and technologies to create a dynamic and engaging user interface. The user interface initially provides two options in the “Home” page. They are the “Standard Menu” and the “Custom Menu.” The standard menu provides the available varieties of burgers and side dishes along with refreshment drink and extras (dips). The custom menu consists of available ingredients (like onions, lettuce, tomatoes, patties, and cheese) out of which the customers can create their own burger. The total cost of the order is constantly updated for the users as they pick the items of different prices at different quantities. Finally, the Total bill is triggered as an alert box to the browser on submission through the “Order” button.

The primary objective of the "Brrrgrrr" project is to provide a platform for users to customize and create their own burgers. This involves implementing the following mandatory requirements:
1. Utilize Arrays for efficient ingredient management.
2. Employ DOM Manipulation techniques to dynamically update the user interface.
3. Ensure ES6 compatibility for modern JavaScript practices.
4. Implement Higher Order Functions for streamlined data processing and manipulation.

Technologies Used-
1.HTML5: Used for structuring the webpage.
2.CSS3: Employed for styling and layout design.
3.ReactJS(React 18)- Building user interface for the multi-paged application.
                              1. JavaScript (ES6)(ECMAScript 2015): Leveraged for dynamic interaction and functionality.
                              2.  Arrays (ES6): Applied for efficient ingredient management.
                              3. DOM Manipulation (ES6): Utilized for real-time updates on the webpage.
                              4. Higher Order Functions (ES6): Integrated for optimized data processing.
4.React Hook(React 18)- For managing and centralizing application state
